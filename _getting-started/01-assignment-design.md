## Different types of choices

###Choice of which assignments to do
Encourage students to show that they have learned material through a variety of mediums by allowing them to choose assignments that appeal to their unique interests and goals.

###Choice of how many assignments to do
Provide students with more assignments than are required to complete to get an A. We typically suggest providing up to 1.5 times as many assignments as usual to make this type of choice most effective.

###Choice of when to do assignments

###Choice of pre-established pathways
Many instructors choose to develop multiple pathways through their course based on the differing motivation of their students. Provide pathways that are less time-consuming for students who come in with a lot of existing subject knowledge or students who are taking the course pass/fail or provide pathways that offer more enrichment for students who are interested in pursuing the field of study.
