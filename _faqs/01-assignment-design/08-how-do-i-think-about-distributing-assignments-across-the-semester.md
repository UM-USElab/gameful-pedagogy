One of the things we’ve discovered is that students will be frustrated if they haven’t levelled up past an F until the very end of the semester. This is common in traditional courses - the majority of your grade, relies on a final exam, or a single semester project. Because of the transparency in the system, and the way GradeCraft tells students what level they’ve earned, this aspect becomes quite prominent for students. We find courses are most successful when we distribute assignments (and thus, earned points) across the semester so that students experience the feeling of progress throughout the semester. We recommend that substantive assignments be distributed throughout the whole semester, with the goal of students being able to level up every week or two throughout the experience. We have a spreadsheet available here to help you map out how points accumulation maps to timeline of the semester. We also strongly recommend having students use the Grade Predictor early in the semester, and then advising everyone to revisit it later in the term (perhaps in section). This can help allay student concerns about their progress.
