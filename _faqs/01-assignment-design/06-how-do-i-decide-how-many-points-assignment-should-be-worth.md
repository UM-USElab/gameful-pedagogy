How many points an assignment is worth is a balance of two things in a gameful system: how challenging it is, and how much you want students to do it. So a semester-long project that gives students the opportunity to engage with many learning objectives in the course should have a high number of points, but an engagement activity like class attendance should also be valued relatively highly. See below for examples of how a couple of different classes have assigned points to different categories of assignments.
