An example of this comes from EDUC222: Videogames & Learning, where students can complete an ‘Individual Paper/Project.’ This assignment is worth a high number of points (slightly more than 10% of what is needed to earn an A), and and about 2/3 of students in the course do at least one of them over the course of the semester. The rubric looks like this:
