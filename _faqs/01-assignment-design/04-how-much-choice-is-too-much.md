Weâ€™re still working on identifying exactly what the maximum amount of choice should be, but we know that when there are more than approximately 20 assignments in a single category, this becomes overwhelming for students to keep track of. However, there are ways to provide support to get around this: you could establish a large number of assignments and only make a few of them available at any one time to help make this manageable, or create archetype assignments that offer many opportunities for students to complete them. For instance, in SI110: Introduction to Information Studies, students are able to complete up to ten Explorer Reports, where they attend a relevant talk on campus and write a reflection on the experience and connect it to the course content. This allows students to have autonomy over which talk to attend, while not creating an overwhelming set of different assignments to make select from.
