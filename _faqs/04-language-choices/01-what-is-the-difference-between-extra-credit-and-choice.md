Extra credit and assignment choice are two strategies that can look quite similar, both in the goals for using them, and in the shape they take practically. But we’ve found that the phrase “extra credit” has a specific meaning for students: in traditional systems where assignments each count for a percentage of the amount up to 100%, they expect that extra credit points are special and will act as a different sort of boost to their grade. In gameful systems you award points directly for each assignment. If you build in assignment choice then there are more points available to students than they actually need to earn. They have the choice to select which assignments match their skill level, interests, and time requirements. But points for each and every assignment are counted the same, and some types of points aren’t more beneficial to your grade than others. *We advise against using the term “extra credit”*.
