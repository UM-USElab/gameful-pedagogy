We recommend you think about naming levels in a way that makes sense within your content. Think about the level names as an additional way for students to naturally pick up language (and hierarchy) that is embedded in the material they’re studying.

Excellent examples we’ve seen in the past: a Spanish class that used location names on a trip to reflect progress; a class on Videogames that named levels after historical platforms; and a class on the History of Science that named levels after beings representing different stages of evolution.  Badge names often also reflect the semiotic domain, or else broaden the perspective to connect to soft skills (Creativity, Group Work, Leadership, etc.) we value across domain.
