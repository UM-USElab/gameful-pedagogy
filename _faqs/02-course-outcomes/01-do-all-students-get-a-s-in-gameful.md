Definitely not! But you’re likely to see a higher number than normal, especially when compared to classes that have a curve applied after the fact. When you make the expectations to earn a high grade transparent, students will be empowered to do exactly that. Not all students will manage it, for a variety of reasons--but we believe that an intrinsically motivating learning environment should make it possible for all students to earn excellent grades if they’re willing to do rigorous work at a high level. We argue that the rigor of a course should be reflected in its learning goals and the challenge presented by assignments - not by how many (or few) students receive an “A” at the end of the term.
