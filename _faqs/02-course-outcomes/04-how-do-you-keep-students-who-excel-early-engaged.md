Gameful courses make it possible to design better learning experiences for students who need more practice and support in the content area, as well as students who come with a high skill level and need to be challenged. For the latter, we recommend creating assignment sequences, where early work unlocks later assignments that makes use of the earlier lessons to create a more interesting and advanced assessment. Another way to ensure students stay engaged is to build the levelling system such that it requires students achieve on a variety of levels to earn advanced grades. An example of this that we’ve seen is courses requiring students have a 90% attendance rate to earn an A - they may have done stellar work outside of this, but they won’t have an A if they haven’t continued to engage in the course experience. However, use required elements like this with caution: as you add more rules like this, you reduce students’ autonomy, and the resulting intrinsic motivation.
