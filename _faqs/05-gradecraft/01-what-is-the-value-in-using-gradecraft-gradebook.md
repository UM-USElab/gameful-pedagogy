GradeCraft was designed to replace the gradebooks of other learning management systems because they each assume that all students should complete all assignments (with some rules about contribution, for instance taking the top 10 grades from a particularly category). The perspective that a class might have more assignments available than students should actually complete is what we have built GradeCraft around. With the creation of this choice, students then need support to make sense of it; the GradeCraft Grade Predictor is built explicitly to do that. The Grade Predictor allows students to plan each assignment than they will engage with, and map out their goals for performance. Before GradeCraft was developed, we saw students be excited about gameful learning but also confused about the choices in front of them. We have found that GradeCraft is successful at help students make sense of their progress in gameful courses.
