We recommend you introduce GradeCraft right at the beginning - it is, in a way, the living syllabus. It’s particularly good at helping students keep track of what’s going on, and encouraging them to set goals for their semester. We have put together a video to help students understand the approach here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxb3wVwmYyc" target="_blank">Intro to Gameful Learning with GradeCraft</a>

Potential things include:

- Which system (Canvas, CTools, or GradeCraft) students should submit work to
- Which system students should expect to receive feedback on
- What the required elements of the course are (the common pathway that everyone engages in)
- What the opportunities are for students to customize the class to their interests and schedules
- How to use the Grade Predictor
