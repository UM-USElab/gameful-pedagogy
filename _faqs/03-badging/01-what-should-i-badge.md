We’ve observed three different types of things badged in courses:

1. Skills (teamwork, presentation skills, creativity)
2. Engagement (attending X lectures in a row, going to on-campus activities)
3. Content Knowledge

When considering adding badges to your course, look at your learning objectives and see if any of them map neatly only skills that might be badged, or if there are clear levels of content knowledge development that lend themselves to badging.

Two challenges about badges as an approach: it’s important that it be very clear to students how they should go about earning them, and it’s important that the moments that they’re awarded match the teaching team’s workflow. If badging is to be successful it needs to be done consistently. Most badging systems embedded in course designs that we’ve seen so far have been challenged by the fact that it adds an additional workflow and assessment process that is above-and-beyond the grading process.
